1) What is cluster and what is hadoop cluster?
        CLUSTER:
               A computer cluster consists of many computers connected together to make a single system.
               The cluster has nodes that perform same tasks.
               This technology has emerged to increase cost effectiveness and to save time.
               The nodes are connected through LAN.They provides much faster processing speed and larger storage capacity.
               It has more advantages over Mainframe computers.
         HADOOP CLUSTER:
               This cluster stores very large amount of structured and unstructured data.
               The Work load is distributed across multiple nodes or various commodity systems.
               The data is processed in parallel.
               When data is sent to a node for analysis,the data is also replicated to other cluster nodes.\
               If a node fails,additional copies of the node's data exist elsewhere in the cluster,so the the data can still be analyzed.
               It is a cost effective technique for top organizations that analyse huge amount of data.
 
 2) What is meant by a Rack and explain the rack arrangement in a hadoop cluster?
    RACK:
         It is the storage of nodes.It is the collection of 30 to 40 nodes that are connected to same network 
         Collections of rack is a hadoop cluster.
    RACK ARRANGEMENT:
          *Usually 30 to 40 nodes are present in a rack.
          *Communication  between two data nodes in the same rack is more efficient than the communication between two data nodes of 
          different racks.
          *Inorder to avoid network traffic while writing HDFS files,name node chooses data rack on the same rack  or the nearby rack
          *When one rack fails,there is a possiblity of the data to be lost.so a replica of the data is made in another rack.no more than one replica is placed in one node
           and no more than two replicas are placed in same rack.
          *When a new Block is created,one replica is placed at local node,another at different rack and another at different node in local rack.
          *For processing,nearby nodes are chosen,so that the speed is boosted up.
          *Inorder to read or write data from two different racks,pipeline is used.Once the process is done,an acknowledgement is sent to name node indicating the completion of process.
          *The data acquired is stored in HDFS.
